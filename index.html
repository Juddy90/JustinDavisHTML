                                <h2>What is your interest in IT and when did it start?</h2>
                                <p>I have been interested in computers and gaming since I was a young child. Some of my best childhood memories are of when my uncle would bring over new PC 
                                    parts for us to upgrade our family computer and when he brought over new PC games for me to play. From there my interest was sparked and I became the 
                                    family nerd; anytime there was an IT issue it would be brought to me first to fix. Due to my lack of formal education and experience within the IT industry 
                                    my experience to date is purely from an enthusiast level.</p>
                                    
                                <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
                                <p>I was recently made redundant from a role in a different industry, and it has been a blessing in disguise. It allowed me to reflect on my current career 
                                    and to decide where I wanted my career path to head to from here. With my passion for technology, it became clear that I should head down this career path. 
                                    I began my search for a university course that would allow me to learn the required knowledge to enter the industry while continuing to job hunt and gain 
                                    employment to be able to continue to provide for my family. OUA had been something I had previously looked at, so I was familiar with how they worked and 
                                    with RMIT being available through them I chose RMIT for my studies.</p>
                                    
                                <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
                                <p>My aim is to acquire the knowledge expected of candidates to enter the IT industry. Topics I would expect to learn in a degree like this include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What IT is and how it impacts people’s lives</li>
                                    <li>Programming</li>
                                    <li>Network</li>
                                    <li>Web design</li>
                                    <li>Business practices within the IT industry</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I am also interested in learning more advanced areas such as cyber security or cloud computing.</p>

                                <p>In an ever-changing industry it can be hard to definitively choose a single career path. I am not the kind of person to decide on one thing and close off 
                                all other options that may arise in the meantime. Despite this, an area that really interests me is cyber security. </p>
                                <p>The job I have found that I believe would be ideal to me is a Microsoft security engineer (https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/1199129). Screenshot: 
                                    <a href="job.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>
                                <p>The main responsibilities in this role are based around security remediation programs and addressing vulnerabilities within the Azure platform. In this 
                                role I would be expected to work with key stakeholders in neutralizing security threats and working towards implementing risk mitigations.</p>
                                <p>This role is appealing to me as the cyber security industry is my current interest in the greater IT industry, coupled with my current onboarding with 
                                Microsoft in a different department, makes me so excited about this role within Microsoft.</p>
                                <p>Prior experience in a security operations role is required for this role, as well as experience within the cyber security industry. Knowledge of cloud 
                                platforms, programming, operating systems, and process improvement are all required for this role, as well as the ability to work in teams and with key 
                                stakeholders.</p>
                                <p>From a technical perspective my skills do not meet this role due to my limited knowledge and experience in the IT industry. However, I have strong interpersonal 
                                skills due to my experience as a manager of a multi-skilled team, coupled with my past education of a Diploma in business.</p>
                                <p>My plan to gain the skills and knowledge revolve around my completion of the Bachelor of Information IT with RMIT and my plan to follow up with a graduate degree 
                                in Cyber Security. As I will already be working for Microsoft by the time I have gained the skills and knowledge, I will be able to leverage my position to gain 
                                the experience required. Microsoft has procedures in place to help staff work towards career goals which include mentoring, cross-training, exposure to other areas 
                                of the business of interest and stretch assignments.</p>

                                <p>The personality quizzes have identified me as an introverted observer with a pragmatic learning style. I am out of my comfort zone when dealing with other people 
                                    while not having very strong emotional stability which results in me avoiding conflict by agreeing with others’ opinions even if I do not agree with them. As an 
                                    observer, I can look for opportunities missed by others. My learning styles however are quite different, preferring to learn by using practical and hands on 
                                    experiences while using that experience to try out new ways of doing things.</p>
                                <p>Working in a group will require me to move outside my comfort zone in certain aspects of my personality. I will need to be conscious of how I am working in a 
                                    group and ensure that I raise any opinions I have regardless of other opinions in a clear and calm manner. I will also need to ensure that I keep my emotions 
                                    in check to avoid potential conflicts and have the confidence to bring new ideas to the table.</p>
                                <p>While forming a team I will look to choose people who have the strengths to fill the weaknesses that I have. I will look for a group mixed introverts and 
                                    extroverts who are comfortable working in groups however will ensure that their traits are not too assertive as this may result in conflict as I 
                                    can sometimes let my emotions take control leading to potential conflict.</p>

                            <p>During the recent pandemic mental health has been a major concern. During 2021, lifeline had seen an increase of 33.1% of daily call volumes (Australian Institute 
                                of Health and Welfare 2022), demonstrating a need to focus on mental health. Too often, people have been isolated and haven’t been in contact with others which can 
                                result in a feeling of loneliness. Another issue that has occurred with a lack of interaction with other people has been the fact that people haven’t heard what a 
                                great job in life they are doing. Parents feel under-appreciated, and workers feel like they are not receiving recognition anymore. This application will work towards 
                                reminding them of their worth and will hopefully increase their moral.</p>
                            <p>Everyday this application will serve the user with a notification showing a positive affirmation or a motivational quote. The user will have the opportunity to give 
                                certain details while signing up such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Male or Female</li>
                                <li>Age</li>
                                <li>Parent</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Users under the age of 16 will be asked to submit a parental email address although for users over the age of 12, this will be voluntary. This will be for child safety. 
                                These answers will allow the user to be served with different affirmations tailored to their life’s circumstances. For example, if the user is a female parent, the 
                                user will be served with affirmations such as “You are doing a great job, mum” or “Your kids may not say it, but they love and appreciate you”, a child of school 
                                age may be served with affirmations such as “You are smart and capable of anything you put your mind to”, or an elderly person may be served with affirmations such 
                                as “You have people who love you in their lives”. When the application launches the aim is to have roughly 200 different affirmations and motivational quotes available 
                                to be given with the aim to increase this to around 500 within 12 months. This would allow for each person to be served a different quote every day for a year instead 
                                of being served the same one multiple times in a year. This application will also allow the user to forward any affirmations on to other people they know if they feel 
                                they are relevant, and the friend or family member could use some encouragement. Every week this application will request the user take part in a quick mental health 
                                quiz of 10 questions which will have the user rate their answers between one and five for questions such as “I feel lonely often?” or “I want this to end?”. This will 
                                track any trends and if the trends continue to track lower over a month or if the answers are of high concern, the user will be served with information on lifeline, 
                                suicide helplines or emergency services. If the user is a child, the trends and results will be visible to a parent incase there are any concerns that they need to 
                                be aware of. While there are similar applications on the market there are no applications that combine the features of positive affirmations, mental health tracking 
                                and support services all in one application. The benefits of this application over others is that it will have all of these features built in to one platform while 
                                also being a free to use application. In the short term, the minimum viable product will include 200 unique affirmations and quotes and will look to add in features 
                                after release such as mental health tracking and support services. This application will be a free application fully funded by advertisements only served if the 
                                application is opened by a notification. This ensures there are limited applications, and the user will only get an advertisement if they are interested in the 
                                material served.</p>
                            <p>This application will be designed and released for IOS which is the operating system found on the Apple iPhone. To design this application, the development 
                                language that will be used will be Swift. Swift is an open-source programming language that developers use to create applications on iPhones, iPad and MacBooks. 
                                Swift works directly with Cocoa and Cocoa Touch which are Apple’s native API and UI frameworks. As there will be data storage and potentially contact details of 
                                a parent or guardian in the app, a server will be required to house all of this. The server that will be used will be the Azure SQL database.</p>
                            <p>The skills required to create and maintain this project will be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Programming skills in Swift</li>
                                <li>An understanding of IOS development</li>
                                <li>An understanding of how Azure SQL database works and how it can be implemented in this scenario</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>While programming can be hard to learn, there is a wealth of knowledge on Swift, IOS development and Azure SQL Database on social media pages such as YouTube as 
                                well as very knowledgeable instruction articles on websites like Udemy which I will be able to utilize to gain the skills required.</p>
                            <p>The goal for this application is to increase mental health while allows users to connect to each other and share positive thoughts. Users will be able to treat 
                                any mental health illnesses early through the tracking system and will have contact details to support systems if they are struggling. This pandemic has been 
                                hard of everybody’s mental health and the aim with this application is to increase mental health or at the minimum increase mental health awareness.</p>
