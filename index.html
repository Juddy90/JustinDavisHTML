                                <h2>What is your interest in IT and when did it start?</h2>
                                <p>I have been interested in computers and gaming since I was a young child. Some of my best childhood memories are of when my uncle would bring over new PC 
                                    parts for us to upgrade our family computer and when he brought over new PC games for me to play. From there my interest was sparked and I became the 
                                    family nerd; anytime there was an IT issue it would be brought to me first to fix. Due to my lack of formal education and experience within the IT industry 
                                    my experience to date is purely from an enthusiast level.</p>
                                    
                                <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
                                <p>I was recently made redundant from a role in a different industry, and it has been a blessing in disguise. It allowed me to reflect on my current career 
                                    and to decide where I wanted my career path to head to from here. With my passion for technology, it became clear that I should head down this career path. 
                                    I began my search for a university course that would allow me to learn the required knowledge to enter the industry while continuing to job hunt and gain 
                                    employment to be able to continue to provide for my family. OUA had been something I had previously looked at, so I was familiar with how they worked and 
                                    with RMIT being available through them I chose RMIT for my studies.</p>
                                    
                                <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
                                <p>My aim is to acquire the knowledge expected of candidates to enter the IT industry. Topics I would expect to learn in a degree like this include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What IT is and how it impacts peopleâ€™s lives</li>
                                    <li>Programming</li>
                                    <li>Network</li>
                                    <li>Web design</li>
                                    <li>Business practices within the IT industry</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I am also interested in learning more advanced areas such as cyber security or cloud computing.</p>

                                <p>In an ever-changing industry it can be hard to definitively choose a single career path. I am not the kind of person to decide on one thing and close off 
                                all other options that may arise in the meantime. Despite this, an area that really interests me is cyber security. </p>
                                <p>The job I have found that I believe would be ideal to me is a Microsoft security engineer (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2873139911). Screenshot: <a href="Job.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here</a></p>
                                <p>The main responsibilities in this role are based around security remediation programs and addressing vulnerabilities within the Azure platform. In this 
                                role I would be expected to work with key stakeholders in neutralizing security threats and working towards implementing risk mitigations.</p>
                                <p>This role is appealing to me as the cyber security industry is my current interest in the greater IT industry, coupled with my current onboarding with 
                                Microsoft in a different department, makes me so excited about this role within Microsoft.</p>
                                <p>Prior experience in a security operations role is required for this role, as well as experience within the cyber security industry. Knowledge of cloud 
                                platforms, programming, operating systems, and process improvement are all required for this role, as well as the ability to work in teams and with key 
                                stakeholders.</p>
                                <p>From a technical perspective my skills do not meet this role due to my limited knowledge and experience in the IT industry. However, I have strong interpersonal 
                                skills due to my experience as a manager of a multi-skilled team, coupled with my past education of a Diploma in business.</p>
                                <p>My plan to gain the skills and knowledge revolve around my completion of the Bachelor of Information IT with RMIT and my plan to follow up with a graduate degree 
                                in Cyber Security. As I will already be working for Microsoft by the time I have gained the skills and knowledge, I will be able to leverage my position to gain 
                                the experience required. Microsoft has procedures in place to help staff work towards career goals which include mentoring, cross-training, exposure to other areas 
                                of the business of interest and stretch assignments.</p>
