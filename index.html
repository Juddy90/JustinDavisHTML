                                    <h2>What is your interest in IT and when did it start?</h2>
                                    <p>I have been interested in computers and gaming since I was a young child. Some of my best childhood 
                                    memories are of when my uncle would bring over new PC parts for us to upgrade our family computer 
                                    and when he brought over new games for me to play on them. From there my interest was sparked and I 
                                    essentially became the family nerd; anytime there was an IT issue it would be brought to me first to 
                                    fix the issue. Due to my lack of formal education and experience within the IT industry my experience 
                                    to date is purely from an enthusiast level.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
                                    <p>I was recently made redundant from a role in a different industry and while that sounds like a bad 
                                    thing it was a blessing in disguise. It allowed me to reflect on my current career and to decide 
                                    where I wanted my career path to head to from here and with my passion for technology it became 
                                    clear I should head down this career path. As such, I began my search for a university course that would allow me to 
                                    learn the required knowledge to enter 
                                    the industry while continuing to job hunt and 
                                    gain employment to be able to continue to provide for my wife and three kids. OUA had been something 
                                    I had previously looked at, so I was familiar with how they worked and with RMIT being available 
                                    through them I chose RMIT for my studies.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
                                    <p>My aim is to acquire the knowledge expected of candidates to enter the IT industry. Topics I would expect to learn in a degree 
                                    like this include what IT is and how it impacts peopleâ€™s lives, programming, network, web design and business 
                                    practices within the IT industry. I am also interested in learning more advanced areas such as cyber security or cloud computing.</p>
